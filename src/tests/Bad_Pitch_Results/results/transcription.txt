Hi, my name is Logan. I want to get an internship because I think it'll look good on my resume. [UM] I'm a psychology major at WVU. I looked up some internships and yours came up first. [UM] I'm in a bunch of clubs on campus. I'm a good writer. I got a B in honors English, which is actually pretty great for that class. I don't really know what you're looking for, but. [UM] good writing is always a plus. [UM] I haven't actually done research yet, but I should probably learn how, and I think an internship could teach me. So [UM] that's about it. Thanks.
